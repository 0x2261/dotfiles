# Dotfiles
A collection of configurations for the different apps I use. These configuration folders and files are used for all different kinds of devices:
- Client development systems, on bare metal.
- Servers that are headless, which should only be connected to through SSH.
- Containers, volatile by design, a temporary and isolated development environment.
